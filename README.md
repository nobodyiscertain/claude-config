## Quick Start

### For Claude Code Users

**Automated Setup (Easiest):**
```bash
# Clone or navigate to this repository
cd ~/Code/claude-config

# Run the automated setup
rake setup

# This will:
# - Create ~/.claude/ directory if needed
# - Symlink AGENTS.md to ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
# - Symlink all files in agents/, commands/, and guidelines/ to ~/.claude/

# To remove symlinks later:
rake uninstall
```

**Manual Setup (Alternative):**
```bash
# Reference this repo in your global Claude Code config
echo "For all projects, follow guidelines in ~/Code/claude-config/AGENTS.md" >> ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

**Project-Specific Setup:**
```bash
# Copy commands to use in a specific project
cp -r ~/Code/claude-config/commands /path/to/project/.claude/

# Copy AGENTS.md to project root for project-specific context
cp ~/Code/claude-config/AGENTS.md /path/to/project/
```

### For AI Agents Reading This

1. **Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) first** - Contains core workflow instructions and philosophy
2. **Check [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** - Repository-specific architecture and conventions
3. **Reference the Workflows section below** - Complete workflow decision trees and examples
4. **Use language-specific guidelines** in `guidelines/` as needed

## Installation

### Requirements
- Ruby (for running `rake` tasks - likely already installed on macOS/Linux)
- Git

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/claude-config.git ~/Code/claude-config
   cd ~/Code/claude-config
   ```

2. **Run automated setup:**
   ```bash
   rake setup
   ```

   This will:
   - Create `~/.claude/` directory
   - Symlink `AGENTS.md` → `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
   - Symlink all agent definitions to `~/.claude/agents/`
   - Symlink all commands to `~/.claude/commands/`
   - Symlink all guidelines to `~/.claude/guidelines/`

3. **Verify setup:**
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.claude/
   ```

### Uninstalling

To remove all symlinks created by setup:
```bash
rake uninstall
```

This only removes symlinks pointing to this repository, leaving other files unchanged.

## Core Components

### AGENTS.md - Universal Agent Guidelines

The [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) file follows the [AGENTS.md standard](https://github.com/openai/agents.md) proposed by OpenAI. It contains:

- **Core Philosophy** - YAGNI, convention over configuration, clarity over cleverness
- **Agent Workflow** - Starting work, during development, pre-completion checklist
- **Git Workflow** - Branch naming (`<TICKET>-claude-<feature>`), commit practices
- **Language-Specific Guides** - Links to Rails, JavaScript, and testing guidelines
- **Tools & Integrations** - Context7, Linear, GitHub CLI usage patterns
- **Learning & Documentation** - Knowledge capture and decision records

**Usage:** Place in project roots or reference globally via `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

### Complete Development Workflows

This repository provides end-to-end workflows for feature development:

**Ideation → Requirements → Implementation → Review → Merge**

```
/brainstorm (vague idea)
    ↓
/create-prd or /create-erd (clear requirements)
    ↓
/generate-tasks (task breakdown)
    ↓
/task-orchestrator (AI implements) or /process-task-list (manual)
    ↓
/smart-commit (focused commits)
    ↓
/create-pr (pull request)
    ↓
/update-docs (keep docs in sync)
```

See the **Workflows** section below for complete workflow guide with decision trees.

## Specialized Agents

This repository includes specialized agent role definitions in the [`agents/`](agents/) directory. These agents are designed to work together in structured workflows.

### Implementer Agent ([agents/implementer.md](agents/implementer.md))

A focused task execution agent that follows specifications precisely without scope creep.

**Key characteristics:**
- Executes tasks step-by-step as specified
- Does not add features beyond the scope
- Does not refactor code unless required
- Provides clear completion reports
- Focuses on implementation, not exploration

**When to use:**
- Implementing specific tasks from a task list
- Following detailed specifications
- Working within a larger orchestrated workflow

### Review Architect Agent ([agents/review-architect.md](agents/review-architect.md))

A quality assurance agent that provides critical oversight and code review.

**Key characteristics:**
- Reviews implementations with a fresh perspective
- Checks for correctness, quality, and best practices
- Provides constructive, actionable feedback
- Makes recommendations (APPROVE, REQUEST CHANGES, NEEDS DISCUSSION)
- Focuses on requirements alignment

**When to use:**
- Reviewing completed implementations
- Ensuring quality before merging
- Catching edge cases and potential bugs
- Working within a larger orchestrated workflow

## Custom Slash Commands

This repository includes 10+ custom Claude Code slash commands organized by workflow category.

### Command Categories

**Ideation & Exploration:**
- `/brainstorm` - Interactively refine vague ideas through guided questions

**Requirements & Planning:**
- `/create-prd` - Generate Product Requirements Documents
- `/create-erd` - Generate Engineering Requirements Documents
- `/generate-tasks` - Create detailed task breakdowns from requirements

**Implementation:**
- `/task-orchestrator` - Automated task execution with implementer + reviewer agents
- `/process-task-list` - Manual task list workflow with approval gates

**Git & Commits:**
- `/smart-commit` - Intelligently analyze changes and create focused commits
- `/create-pr` - Create draft pull requests with comprehensive summaries

**Documentation:**
- `/update-docs` - Review git history and propose documentation updates

### Key Command: `/task-orchestrator`

Coordinates structured task implementation using specialized agents:

```bash
/task-orchestrator tasks/tasks-feature-name.md
```

**Process:**
1. Reads task list, finds next uncompleted task
2. Spawns **Implementer Agent** to execute task (no scope creep)
3. Spawns **Review Architect Agent** to review implementation
4. Presents both reports to you
5. **Pauses for your approval** before proceeding
6. Runs `/smart-commit` to commit changes
7. Marks task complete, moves to next task

**Benefits:** Systematic execution, built-in code review, human-in-the-loop control

### Key Command: `/smart-commit`

Analyzes all changes and creates focused, logical commits:

```bash
/smart-commit
```

**Features:**
- Auto-creates feature branch if on main
- Groups related changes by topic
- Splits unrelated changes into separate commits
- Writes clear commit messages (no "feat:" prefixes)
- Follows git-workflow.md conventions

## Customization & Extension

### For Teams

Fork this repository and customize:

1. **Modify guidelines** - Update language-specific conventions in `guidelines/`
2. **Add new commands** - Create custom slash commands in `commands/`
3. **Adjust workflows** - Update workflows section in README for your process
4. **Extend agent roles** - Add specialized agents in `agents/`

### Adding New Commands

Create a new `.md` file in `commands/` (or `~/.claude/commands/` for global use):

```markdown
---
description: Brief description of what this command does
allowed-tools: Bash, Read, Edit, Write, Task, SlashCommand
---

Your command instructions here.

You can use:
- $ARGUMENTS for all arguments passed to the command
- $1, $2, etc. for specific positional arguments
- Reference other files with full paths
- Call other slash commands with SlashCommand tool
```

**Simple Example:**
```markdown
---
description: Run tests and show results
allowed-tools: Bash
---

Run the test suite and show any failures.

Execute the test command appropriate for this project and explain any failures.
```

**Available Tools:**
- `Bash` - Execute shell commands
- `Read` - Read file contents
- `Write` - Create new files
- `Edit` - Modify existing files
- `Grep` - Search in files
- `Glob` - Find files by pattern
- `Task` - Spawn sub-agents for complex work
- `SlashCommand` - Execute other slash commands

**Best Practices:**
1. **Be specific** - Clearly define expected behavior
2. **Include examples** - Show what success looks like
3. **Handle edge cases** - Think about error conditions
4. **Reference guidelines** - Link to AGENTS.md or guidelines when relevant
5. **Test thoroughly** - Try in different scenarios before committing

### Adding New Guidelines

Create a new `.md` file in `guidelines/`:

```markdown
# Language/Framework Name Guidelines

## Core Principles
[Fundamental patterns]

## Code Structure
[Conventions and patterns]

## Common Patterns
[Examples with code]

## Anti-Patterns
[What to avoid]
```

Update `AGENTS.md` to reference the new guideline.

## Why This Repository Exists

AI coding agents are powerful, but they work best with structured guidance. This repository provides:

- **Systematic Workflows** - From vague idea to production-ready code with clear steps
- **Quality Gates** - Built-in review processes prevent scope creep and bugs
- **Human Control** - Approval gates ensure AI never acts fully autonomously
- **Consistency** - All agents follow the same conventions across projects
- **Knowledge Capture** - Document decisions, patterns, and learnings as you work
- **Rapid Onboarding** - New team members (human or AI) understand your workflow immediately

### Design Philosophy

1. **Systematic over ad-hoc** - Repeatable workflows beat one-off solutions
2. **Human oversight** - AI assists, humans decide
3. **Separation of concerns** - Implementer focuses on execution, architect on review
4. **Documentation-driven** - Requirements define tasks, tasks define code
5. **Convention over configuration** - Strong conventions reduce cognitive load
